Copyright 2025 Mov.ai (By Paulo Quirino)

This project is based on work I authored during my time at Mov.ai under a POC branch.
The original work referenced the ISC license in its `package.json` file, which still applies.
The orphans functionality (BST) is made on my free time and might be considered derivative work.

NOTE: Mov.ai retains all rights to the original work authored as part of my employment.
This adaptation and further developments are provided under the same ISC license terms.

NOTE: These terms are subject to revision only if Mov.ai formally requests adjustments
to address ownership or licensing concerns related to the original work.

This library is released as open-source software under the ISC license.
Users are encouraged to comply with the terms outlined here and to report any issues or concerns.
